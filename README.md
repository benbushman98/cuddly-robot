# cuddly-robot food crawl

DESCRIPTION:
This application is designed to provide guidance to users that are looking for a restaurant in a specific location, given their preferences.

The webpage presents input fields to set up the parameters that will provide the user the desired information about the sites that can be found in the area in a 10-km radius. Once the user provides those parameters (city, state and distance), the application saves the information of favorite places for a more convenient experience. If the user wishes to clear the history of searched locations, the platform also provides that option. 

The information the user can see in its search includes :

- Restaurant's name
- Rating
- Picture of the location 
- Address
- Current hours status

DEVELOPMENT PROCESS:
In order to develop this application, the technology of HTML, CSS and JavaScript worked together to make it possible. For example:

- Bulma CSS framework was used along with customized selectors that fusioned efficiently to provide the application with a professional appearance. 

- The platform is interactive and user-friendly. With the JavaScript technology, the application allows the user to get accurate feedback based on its choices. This application is based on three Server-Side APIs: Google Maps, Open Weather Map, and Heroku app. A Third-Party API, Google Fonts, was also used to customize the brand's name "Cuddly-Robot Food Crawl".
